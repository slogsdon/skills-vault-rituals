description: Use when /eod is invoked or when Shane wants to close out his day. Diffs Today's Focus vs Session Log, increments deferrals in patterns.md for unlogged tasks, flags items at 3+ deferrals, and writes an EOD Audit to today's daily note.

# Skill: /eod

End-of-day accountability audit. Delegate analysis to Qwen; Claude handles writes.

## Steps

1. Determine today's date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
2. Read these files using obsidian CLI:
   - `obsidian read file='Daily Notes/[today's date]'`
   - `obsidian read file='Context/patterns'`
   - `obsidian read file='Context/accountability'`
3. Call `mcp__lmstudio-agent__qwen_start` (standalone) or `mcp__plugin_shane-config_lmstudio-agent__qwen_start` (plugin — use whichever is available) with:
   - `task`: "You are Shane's EOD accountability agent. Compare the 'Today's Focus' section against the 'Session Log' section in today's daily note (provided). For each focus item NOT reflected in the session log, flag it as deferred. Check patterns.md for existing deferral counts and increment them. Flag any item now at 3+ deferrals with: 'PATTERN ALERT: [task] has been deferred [N] times. Is this actually a priority?' Output: (1) EOD Audit block for the daily note, (2) updated rows for patterns.md Deferred Tasks Log."
   - `skill`: "eod"
   - `context`: content of all three files
4. Loop: if `status` is `"running"`, call `mcp__lmstudio-agent__qwen_continue` (or `mcp__plugin_shane-config_lmstudio-agent__qwen_continue` in plugin) with `session_id`; repeat until `status` is `"done"` or `"error"`
5. Walk check:
   - Ask Shane: "Did you walk today? (y/n / skipped)"
   - Log to today's session log: `obsidian append file='Daily Notes/[today's date]' content='**[HH:MM]** 🚶 Walk: [yes/no/skipped]'`
   - If yes: in patterns.md find `walk_streak_missed` and reset to 0 (skip if field absent)
   - If no or skipped: find or add `walk_streak_missed` in patterns.md, increment by 1; flag if 3+
6. Parse Qwen's `result`:
   - Run `obsidian append file='Daily Notes/[today's date]' content='## EOD Audit\n\n[audit block]'`
   - Run `obsidian append file='Context/patterns' content='[updated deferral rows]'` (or use read→edit cycle if replacing existing rows)
   - For each item Qwen marks as completed today: read `Context/accountability`, find the matching planning note status line (e.g., "visual polish remaining", "in progress"), and update it to reflect completion with the date. Use the Write tool on the vault file path directly (`~/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/Personal/Context/accountability.md`). This keeps accountability.md current so /morning always sees accurate state.
7. If any day had no session log entries at all, add a `## Logging Gap` entry to that day's note
8. Commit the vault changes:
   ```bash
   VAULT="$HOME/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/Personal"
   git -C "$VAULT" add -A && git -C "$VAULT" commit -m "docs: append EOD audit to [today's date]"
   ```
9. Present the audit summary to Shane

## Fallback (if qwen_start/qwen_continue unavailable)

Execute the skill directly:

1. Determine today's date (YYYY-MM-DD)
2. Read the following files via bash:
   - `obsidian read file='Daily Notes/[today's date]'`
   - `obsidian read file='Context/patterns'`
   - `obsidian read file='Context/accountability'`
3. Diff focus vs session log:
   - Extract items from `## Today's Focus`
   - Extract completed items from `## Session Log`
   - Items in focus but NOT in session log = deferred today
3a. Walk check:
    - Ask "Did you walk today? (y/n / skipped)"
    - Note current time (HH:MM); log: `obsidian append file='Daily Notes/[today's date]' content='**[HH:MM]** 🚶 Walk: [yes/no/skipped]'`
    - If yes: find `walk_streak_missed` in patterns.md; reset to 0 if present
    - If no or skipped: find or add `walk_streak_missed` in patterns.md, increment by 1; add PATTERN ALERT if 3+
4. For each deferred item, check `Context/patterns.md` Deferred Tasks Log:
   - If it exists: increment the deferral count
   - If new: add a row with count = 1
   - If count reaches 3+: add a PATTERN ALERT line
5. Build the EOD Audit block:
   ```markdown
   ## EOD Audit

   **Completed:** [items from session log that matched focus]
   **Deferred:**
   - [task] (deferred [N] times total) [PATTERN ALERT if N >= 3]

   **Logging gaps:** [note if session log was empty]
   **OKR alignment:** [brief assessment of whether completed work mapped to active OKRs]
   ```
6. Append the audit block to `Daily Notes/[today's date].md`
7. Update the Deferred Tasks Log section in `Context/patterns.md` with new/incremented rows
8. If the session log was empty, also add a `## Logging Gap` entry to today's note
9. Commit the vault changes:
   ```bash
   VAULT="$HOME/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/Personal"
   git -C "$VAULT" add -A && git -C "$VAULT" commit -m "docs: append EOD audit to [today's date]"
   ```
10. Present the audit summary to Shane
